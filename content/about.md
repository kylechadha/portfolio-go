## Hi there, I'm Kyle
I'm a full stack developer with a background in management consulting. Between the two, I've been able to work on a lot of cool things (and in a lot of cool places!), and am hungry for more.

I currently spend my days playing with Go and a few other cool technologies (Nginx, Knockout, RabbitMQ, to name a few) at Makeable, an NYC based startup. Outside of work, I'm a city captain for Tea With Strangers (check us out at <a href="http://teawithstrangers.com" target="_blank">teawithstrangers.com</a>) and enjoy hacking on my own Go <a href="https://github.com/kylechadha?tab=repositories" target="_blank">side projects</a>.
