+++

For my second challenge I meditated 1-2x a day each day for 2 months. This challenge was quite a bit different than my last challenge, and while the experience overall was positive, meditating and getting into the meditation mindset was a lot harder than I anticipated. Ultimately, this challenge was not as successful as my last challenge.

When I first started looking into having meditation as my potential challenge, I read that:

This made a ton of sense to me. Practice meditation for 15 minutes a day, be a calmer, more resilient, and more focused persona (?)

** Try to paint in some of the HOPE that you felt before starting the challenge. The opportunity that meditation presented, it's potential for impact.

My reasons for the challenge:
- I hoped to gain a better understanding of meditation, how it works and how to practice
- I hoped to build a consistent meditation practice, and,
- I hoped to begin to see positive effects from meditation: a greater ability to deal with stress, more resiliency, and more focus in my work

I intended to accomplish this by meditating 1-2x a day, and didn't leave it any more presciptive than that. Duration, guided vs unguided, mindful vs otherwise were all TBD based on how the experience went.

So what was the outcome?
1) Let's start with the stats. Overall, I meditated a total of X times over Y days. I ended up doing more sessions a day when I was feeling into it, but also missing a lot of days despite my best efforts when I wasn't. 
1) As for duration, technique etc. ... At first I started out with unguided meditation, and then I switched to guided using Headspace. As the challenge went on I pushed the duration from 10m a session to 15m session and enjoyed the increased duration. Although it would have been tough with my schedule, I think 20-30minutes is probably a better duration, since a lot of time and effort goes into getting into the zone (and sometimes it never happens at all)
- The really hard part was focusing on my breathing and noticing my thoughts rather than actually thinking about them. At one point I was doing a "tagging" exercise (where you tag your thoughts and then let them pass without indulging them), and I realized I was having a new thought, tagging it, and coming back to my breath incessantly, probably even more than once a second. There's a LOT of constant analysis going on in my brain, and I really, truly struggled with chilling that out. The more I tried to focus, or not focus, or just breathe, the more I felt like I was spinning my wheels and ending up less equanimous rather than more.
>> maybe just get into the downsides here

The Upsides (Or just >Takeaways)
1) I did learn some really cool stuff (research)
1) The concept of noticing my emotions has been huge -- it's been a really cool technique to pull myself out of that immediate stimuli-response paradigm and at least NOTICE that I might be feeling or acting the way I am because of some underlying emotions. I think this is one of those things that truly takes a lot of effort and practice, but that I'm going to be using and thinking about for a long time to come.

The Downsides
1) But I also realized that I didn't know pretty much anything about meditation going in, and a had a lot of ill concieved notions about what it was and what it was supposed to provide me. I placed a lot of the emphasis on the outcome, and when nothing really changed in my life I got the hint that I had probably been thinking about this wrong.
1) I never felt like I was actually any good at meditating. I think it takes a lot more patience and practice than I thought with my naive understanding going in.

Ultimately
- Glad I tried it, learned a lot and had some fun exploring something new, but don't think I'm going to continue meditating on a daily basis in a strict sense. I'd love to continue to do it ad hoc, and hopefully revisit it at a later point in my life

So what's up next?
I was initially planning on hosting 1-2x tea times a week for Tea With Strangers, since I've been majorly slacking on that and think building hosting into my routine would be a great way to do it more without the fear I might be feeling super introverted that day. But, I recently came across an idea that's set my mind on fire and I want to capitalize... meh.... this should be something personal though, do you really want to make codersalary your challenge. What if you FAIL at investing the time? AGH.... would need to start dedicating all morning sessions. WHich is fine... haven't even been having morning sessions recently x_x

... [needs some work] But, have since been presented with a really cool opportunity for a small project I could see being successful.

I haven't ever buitl a web app and tried to "release it into the wild" (usually I build them for fun, or around specific tools I want, see: http://fresh-tomatoes.herokuapp.com/ UPDATE: sadly this just broke, it was a web scraper and it looks like Rotten Tomatoes has changed their page markup), and I think it'd be a fantastic exercise to do that. Not only would I be able to code with purpose (which is always the most fun), but I'd also be able to learn about all the other softer skills that I don't have much experience with (UX design, sharing my ideas, attempting to find users and gain traction etc.)

So that's what's up next! The goal is to build out the site to the point where it can see its first users, and as a stretch goal, give a talk on it at a meetup!



I think this last one is where I went wrong. I put a lot of pressure on myself to "be good" at meditation, and a lot of emphasis on the results, without really knowing what meditation was.

>> Research was super cool, the piece that really stuck with me (that I'm sure I've already verbally shared with most everyone I talk to): meditation works by...

>> Stats. Overall, I meditated a total of X times. I ended up doing more sessions a day when I was feeling into it, but also missing a lot of days despite my best efforts when I wasn't.

>> Takeaways. While I didn't really get the things I was hoping to, and, ultimately, am not sure if I am going to continue meditating on a daily basis in a strict sense, I did learn a couple of really cool things:
-- My research taught me that ... (above point could be here)
-- The concept of noticing my emotions and how I'm feeling each day has been huge
-- I'd love to continue to improve my breathing, and
