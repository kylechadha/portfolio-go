I came across my friend <a href="http://2015projectawesome.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Sophia's blog</a> the other day. Each month she undertakes a different challenge -- cutting out sugar, radical generosity, becoming a chess master -- and then writes about her experiences. In many ways, I realized I already do this. I spent the last year and a half learning to code, I spent the last few months learning to swim with technique, and the last month and a half learning to be a functional cook. These were great, and I'm proud of the progress I've made in these areas, but there's a fundamental difference between what I've been doing, and what Sophia's doing. Sophia's focus is _singular_ and _intentional_. At every point in a month she knows what her focus is, she's actively measuring her progress, and she's keeping herself accountable by making it public.

I'm working on and focusing on a lot of things at once -- coding, working out, being more strict with my routine, dance lessons, trying to read more, cooking more often, trying to wake up earlier, etc. For all but my top priorities that means sometimes I make progress and sometimes I don't. What I'd like to do is overcome the initial <a href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2011/07/13/obsession/" target="_blank">activation cost</a> for an activity, and then build that component into my routine so it can be maintained and refined over a long period of time.

So, I'm stealing a bit of Sophia's brilliance and adopting her format. I'll pick one thing to work on at a time, writing one post about what I hope to accomplish and the potential challenges I might face before I begin, and one post describing how it went and what I learned once it's done. I'll tweak Sophia's format slightly -- making each challenge last two months. As a general rule, challenges should be specific and measurable -- nothing too broad or abstract.

## Challenge #1
For the first challenge I'm going to focus on waking up at a set time. For the months of November and December I'll be waking up at 6:30am every day. On weekends I don't mind if that slips a little, but unless I was out late, I'll still plan to wake up at 6:30am to help with the weekday routine. I've tried to do this on and off for the last few months with mixed results.

## What I Hope to Accomplish
In my opinion waking up at the same time is the foundation of a set routine, and waking up early is an important part of my goal of having a few hours of personal time before I take calls for work. I'm hoping that by waking up at 6:30am every day I ensure I have time for and prioritize all the things I hope to accomplish in a day.

I am cognizant of the fact that just waking up at a certain time doesn't mean I'll actually accomplish all the things I want to, but I do think they're correlated, and I'm curious to see how much of an impact it has on accomplishing my other goals. Is there a snowball effect, am I more energized about my goals -- or am I just more tired? Do I miss out on social gatherings and feel suffocated, or more relaxed knowing I've tackled my highest priorities before I start the day. 

## Potential Challenges
The tricky part of this challenge is that waking up at a fixed time means sleeping at a fixed time. I'm not the kind of person who can or is interested in reducing the amount I sleep, so if I'm not going to be flexible with when I wake up I absolutely have to be fixed in when I go to sleep. Which I'll certainly miss out on some of the fun.

## Future Challenges
Admittedly, this challenge is a bit mundane, since it has only to do with self-control. I think this is a good foundation for accomplishing a lot of other things in my life, which is why I'm doing it first, but I think the others will be a bit more fun. Some things on the radar:

 - Becoming a better chef -- cooking 4 meals worth of food every Sunday
 - Decreasing stimulus -- removing TV, movies, etc. from my life
 - Meditating -- meditating for 15 minutes twice a day
 - Reading -- reading for 45 minutes before bed
 - Learn piano
