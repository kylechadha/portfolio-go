I came across my friend <a href="http://2015projectawesome.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Sophia's blog</a> the other day. Each month she undertakes a different challenge -- cutting out sugar, radical generosity, becoming a chess master -- and then writes about her experiences. In many ways, I realized I already do this. I spent the last year and a half learning to code, I spent the last few months learning to swim with proper technique, and the last month and a half learning to be a "functional" cook. These were great, and I'm proud of the progress I've made in these areas, but there's a fundamental difference between what I've been doing, and what Sophia's doing. Sophia's focus is _singular_ and _intentional_. At every point in time she knows what her goal is, is actively measuring her progress, and is keeping herself accountable by making it public.

I'm working on and focusing on a lot of things at once -- coding, working out, trying to read more, cooking more often, trying to wake up earlier, etc. For all but my top priorities that means sometimes I make progress and sometimes I don't. What I'd like to do is overcome the initial <a href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2011/07/13/obsession/" target="_blank">activation cost</a> for an activity, move up the learning curve, and then build that component into my routine so it can be maintained and refined over a long period of time.

So, I'm stealing a bit of Sophia's ingenuity and adopting her format. I'll pick one thing to work on at a time, write one post about what I hope to accomplish and then another describing how it went and what I learned. I'll tweak Sophia's format slightly -- making each challenge last two months. As a general rule, challenges should be specific and measurable -- nothing too broad or abstract.

## Challenge #1
For the first challenge I'm going to focus on waking up at a set time. For the months of November and December I'll be waking up at 6:30am every day. On weekends I don't mind if that slips a little, but unless I was out late, I'll still plan to wake up at 6:30am to help with the weekday routine. I've tried to do this on and off for the last few months unsuccessfully.

## What I Hope to Accomplish
In my opinion waking up at the same time is the foundation of a set routine, and waking up early is an important part of my goal of having a few hours of personal time before I take calls for work. I'm hoping that by waking up at 6:30am every day I ensure I have time for and prioritize the things I hope to accomplish longer term. There's also a bit of a snowball effect: when you start things off right, it's much easier to build momentum.

I am cognizant of the fact that just waking up at a certain time doesn't mean I'll actually accomplish everything I want to, but I do think they're correlated, and I'm curious to see how much of an impact waking up early has on accomplishing my other goals. Is there a snowball effect; am I more energized about my goals? Or am I just more tired? Do I miss out on social gatherings and feel suffocated? Or am I more relaxed knowing I've tackled my highest priorities before I leave the house. 

## Potential Issues
The tricky part of this challenge is that waking up at a fixed time means sleeping at a fixed time. I'm not the kind of person who can or is interested in reducing the amount I sleep, so if I'm not going to be flexible with when I wake up I absolutely have to be fixed in when I go to sleep. Easier said than done when NYC is the city that never sleeps.

## Future Challenges
Admittedly, this challenge is a bit mundane, since it has only to do with building a routine for myself. I think this is a good foundation for accomplishing a lot of other things in my life, which is why I'm doing it first, but I think the others will be a bit more fun. Some things on the radar:

 - Meditating -- studying and practicing meditation on a daily basis
 - Becoming a better chef -- cooking 4 meals worth of food every Sunday
 - Decreasing stimulus -- removing TV, movies, etc. from my life
 - Reading -- reading for 60 minutes before bed
 - Removing sugar from my diet
 - Learning Piano? Tango? French?
